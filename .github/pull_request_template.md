## Specs

### Designs

<!-- This should be almost an exact parity of the current site design. -->

### Notes

## Validation

- [ ] Pull down the branch
- [ ] Run `npm install`, then `npm start`
- [ ] In your editor, find the `src/scss` directory. The `main.scss` fille still has vanilla CSS included, along with the beginnings of an ITCSS structure, but this PR only removes styles that pertain to the contact section near the bottom of the page
<!-- Write additional validation if needed. -->
<!-- - [ ] Visit the [homepage](http://localhost:8080/) -->
<!-- Example:
- [ ] Inspect the contact section. Class names on elements should follow the BEM convention (i.e. `cmp-contact`, `cmp-contact__text`, `cmp-contact__link`, etc.). The text "Shoot Me a Message" should use the new utility class `util-bold`.
- [ ] Inspect the "Get in Touch" button. It should use the new utility class `util-bold`.
- [ ] Change the screen size and ensure that visually, nothing in the contact section breaks. The text should stack vertically on top of the button for small screens, then reorient to be horizontal, in line with the button.
- [ ] Visit the [projects](http://localhost:8080/work/work-examples.html), [resume](http://localhost:8080/resume/resume.html), [contact](http://localhost:8080/contact/contact.html) and [blog](http://localhost:8080/blog/blog.html) pages. Verify the styles of the contact section behave the same as on the homepage. -->
