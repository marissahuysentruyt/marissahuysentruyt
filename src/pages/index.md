intro: |
  My name is Marissa and I'm starting my second career as a web developer! I've been working in public education for the last 6 years, and recently started dabbling in development. I really enjoy the problem-solving aspect and detail-driven nature of building user-friendly interfaces! Feel free to poke around my portfolio here, and shoot me an email if I can answer any questions!
