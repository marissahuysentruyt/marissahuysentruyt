  Welcome to my portfolio. I'm an educator turned Front End Developer.
introClass: 'intro__text'
intro: |
  My name is Marissa and I'm a front end developer! I started out in life as a musician, worked as an elementary band director in public education for seven years, and recently made a career pivot into development. I really enjoy the problem-solving aspect and detail-driven nature of building user-friendly interfaces! Web accessibility and good documentation appeal to my inner teacher, while my instrumental side loves the camaraderie of seeking out advice and differing viewpoints from my teammates. Feel free to poke around my portfolio here, and shoot me an email if I can answer any questions!
