overview: |
  For the apprenticeship capstone project, my cohort was tasked with creating a site dedicated to accessibility. The four of us built, tested, and deployed the entire site with the help of our apprentice mentors and leads. The site currently features four components, and each component has a code example, semantic requirements, and even common ARIA pitfalls for developers to be aware of.

  This was one of the first &ldquo;complete&rdquo; project I was a part of! As one of the four apprentices with Sparkbox at the time, we had lofty goals to build this site. Our design team created the illustrative style, layout, and some of the functionality. In general, I helped create React components, like the code sandbox and dialog, worked heavily in the SCSS partials especially to implement light and dark modes, and added Jest as our unit test runner.

  Our apprentice leads ran this project just as a client project, with scrum ceremonies, a Jira board, and progress demos. I enjoyed our stand-ups and the Jira access because it helped me contextualize my work into the project as whole. There were a few times where we, as apprentices, overwrote each other's work as we learned how to better communicate our progress and figured out where some of our cards overlapped. I volunteered to lead the final demos (I like to say I was &ldquo;the driver&rdquo;) while the four of us presented our work as a story, instead of separate, chunks of work that happened to merge into the same project.

  One thing I'm particularly proud of during this project was taking on the Airtable work. I had never worked with databases, and was uncomfortable writing much JavaScript, especially when calling an API. Thankfully, I had lots of help and support from my mentor and project leads. I needed to do several things- write a script to ping our database for a component's data, create tests for that script, and update our current page component to use the returned component data. This work really stretched me and helped me understand how the bits of repo should work together.
