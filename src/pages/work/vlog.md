overview: |
  The Neverland Travelers is what my husband and I call our YouTube channel. We have vlogged our vacations, and I created a website to share upcoming trip information. The site contains photos, videos, contact information, and an &quot;About&quot; section as well.

contribution: |
  I designed, built and deployed this entire website. This was the first website I created to implement everything I was learning on my own. I used as much HTML & CSS as I could, making sure the pages were responsive. I had never deployed a website before, so using GitHub Pages, I launched our site! There's plenty of room on this first project for me to refactor code to be more readable, and clean up the design and visual styles.
