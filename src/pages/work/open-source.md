overview: |
  The Adobe Spectrum organization recently embarked in updating their design system from Spectrum 1 to Spectrum 2. I was part of the contracting team assisting the Adobe Spectrum CSS engineers. We helped introduced major changes by deprecating an older, static documentation site in favor of documentation in the CSS team's Storybook instance. We also were a major part of migrating CSS components from the S1 design language to the new S2 language.

  For over 6 months, I contributed in several ways to the Spectrum CSS project. My first role was migrating documentation from a separate static site into Spectrum CSS's Storybook. We wanted to capture all variants and code examples from the static site, and utilize Adobe's refreshed build system for Storybook to showcase everything in one place. This reduced the amount of documentation and places consumers had to go for the information they may be looking for. I also got to create the 404 page from scratch when we finalized Storybook as our documentation site.

  The Spectrum organization began work on their migration from Spectrum 1 to Spectrum 2 even before I was part of the CSS team. Spectrum 2 introduced breaking changes in almost every component, but not just for the CSS team. The major consumer of our CSS is Spectrum Web Components (SWC), so any breaking changes we introduced also meant breaking changes for that team. We leveraged the expertise of the full-time Adobe team members, allowing them to float over to the web components team and begin restructuring the CSS build systems in order to make it more immediately consumable to SWC. I remained on the CSS side of the migration to Spectrum 2, so I contributed by creating React-based resource links to SWC components, adding design assets, and migrating CSS components to use the new Spectrum 2 language.

  The team moves fast, we had varying priorities to juggle, and at the same time, Adobe needed to onboard three new employees. I really enjoyed getting to work with the newer employees, sharing what I had learned from my time, and finding ways to allow them the space to share their knowledge with me. I try to be open about things I don't know and have questions on, and over time, I think that made more of the team feel like they could reach out to any of the contractors when they needed a hand with a task.
