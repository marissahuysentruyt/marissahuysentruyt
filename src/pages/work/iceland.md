overview: |
  In order to get more experience working with real designs, I headed to Dribbble. I found a landing page dedicated to Iceland and wanted to build it. Because I only had the Dribbble design, I added my own interactivity. After hovers, some minor Javascript and my first image carousel, this page is almost complete.

contribution: |
  I built this landing page from scratch. Because I only had the one design to work with, I added some subtle and tasteful extras, including all of the hovers, the blue bars that load when scrolled to (in the Race section), responsiveness, a proper mobile menu, and the image carousel. Before checking it off my list, I want to add the selected states for the navigation, a "thank you" modal for submitting the form, and figure out how to prevent the mobile menu from bumping down the rest of the content.
