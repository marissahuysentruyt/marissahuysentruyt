            <!-- why am i writing these blogs -->
            I am not a writer. But, with the encouragement of some developer friends that I look up to and have so much respect for (both of these guys are top-notch, supportive, PLUS they are so willing to share and help me learn!), I started a blog. As much as I don't think my story is all that interesting, maybe others will think so. I can't be the only one out there struggling to teach myself, so maybe I can shed some light on how I've been doing things and learning front end. I have no right answers, just the answers that have worked for me. 
        </p>

        <p>
            I'm not pleading with anybody to read these. I'm not making any money off of these posts. But by writing them, I feel like I'm holding myself more accountable. Each blog is helping me view myself as the developer I want to be.
