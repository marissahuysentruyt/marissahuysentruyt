                Music has always been an important part of my life. I remember being so excited when I finally got
                to 5th grade because I knew I would finally be able to pick up an real instrument. I also remember my
                parents getting annoyed when I would practice for too long! Early on in my studies, I knew music would
                be with me for a lifetime. It's what I listen to while driving, when cleaning my house, and what makes
                me happier than anything.

                I graduated from Wayne State University in Detroit, MI with a Bachelor's degree in music performance. For
                a few years, I went semi-professional, performing with several local orchestras. I earned my Teaching 
                Certificate in the process, and have been teaching elementary band ever since. Oboe is my main passion though,
                so I continue to love giving lessons to new oboists.
