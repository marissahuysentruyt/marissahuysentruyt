                I love teaching students. Oboe is my absolute passion, and when I get to share that passion with new
                players, it's so invigorating! I've been teaching privately for over 15 years, and don't plan on stopping
                any time soon! My students consistently score high at Solo/Ensemble events while also attending area honor
                ensembles. I am so thankful to see that they are great leaders within their school bands, as well.

                My professional teaching experience is born and bred in southeast Michigan. After graduating from Marysville High
                School, I earned both my Bachelor of Music (in performance) and my Teaching Certificate from Wayne 
                State University. I worked through college with schools such as Marysville, Anchor Bay and Eisenhower
                High Schools, as well as Orchard Lake Middle School. I was either an instructor at marching 
                band camps, a clinician, or a private lesson tutor. My student teaching occurred at Ruether Middle 
                School and Fraser High School. 
                <br><br>
                Luckily, I was able to secure a position as the Elementary Band Director in Fraser. I teach at 6 elementary 
                schools, focusing on 5th and 6th grade instrumental music. 3 courses are taught at the elementary level: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduction to Instrumental Music (recorder class)</li>
                    <li>Beginning Band 5</li>
                    <li>Beginning Band 6</li>
                </ul> 
                As a bonus, I also get the privelege of uniting amazingly talented 6th graders for an 
                after-school jazz band! We put on 4 concerts per year: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Recorder Concert</li>
                    <li>Winter Band Concert for 5th & 6th grades</li>
                    <li>Spring Band Concert for 5th & 6th grades</li>
                    <li>Jazz Band Concert, featuring our 6th graders, alongside the older jazz students</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Although I do love teaching my full bands, private lessons are truly the best way for students to get the
                help they need. One-on-one interaction with an expert on their instrument is essential. There's no better way
                for a student to be challenged where they should, and given the opportunities to improve where they need. First
                and foremost, any serious musician needs to find a private teacher to foster their love of the instrument.
