Hello! My name is Marissa and I've been teaching myself development! 

I actually have a background mainly in public education (teaching music specifically), but took up dev as a hobby. I ended up getting really invested, and I'm ready to make a career change. Below are some of the projects I've done been working on. All of these have been done because I want to put what I've been learning into real practice. Feel free to visit my portfolio site for more details on each of these!
