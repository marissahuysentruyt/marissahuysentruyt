# marissa huysentruyt :)

Hello! My name is Marissa and I've been teaching myself development! 

I actually have a background mainly in public education (teaching music specifically), but took up dev as a hobby. I ended up getting really invested, and I'm ready to make a career change. Below are some of the projects I've done been working on. I wanted to put what I've been learning into real practice, so you'll be able to see the improvements as you browse (hopefully!). Feel free to visit my portfolio site for more details on each of these!
