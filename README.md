Hello! My name is Marissa and I'm a teacher turned frontend developer!

My background is actually in public education, as an elementary band teacher. I took up development as a hobby, created a website for a personal YouTube channel, and totally fell in love with it! I ended up getting really invested, and was able to participate in a full-stack developer apprenticeship, with the BEST people I could've asked for. That fueled my career change, and I've been able to continue working with those amazing humans. Below are some of the projects I've worked on recently. Feel free to visit my portfolio site for more details on each of these!

For the brave- browse the rest of my repositories. I'm just waiting for the right time to refactor all of the older repos. ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜†

## Projects

### Adobe Spectrum Design Engineering

As a contractor, I've most recently collaborated with the Adobe Spectrum Web Engineering team, first on the Spectrum CSS team, then expanding to Spectrum Web Components, as well.

### Accessibility Cheatsheets

During my apprenticeship, our capstone project was called Accessible Components Cheatsheets. Not only was it a collaborative project with demos and product stakeholders, it was a great way for me learn more about web accessibility.

### National Council of State Boards of Nursing (NCSBN)

As a long-time Sparkbox client, NCSBN has gone through many engagements, several of which I've been a part of.
