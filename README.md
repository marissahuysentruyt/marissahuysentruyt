Hello! My name is Marissa and I'm a teacher turned frontend developer! 

My background is actually in public education, as an elementary band teacher. I took up dev as a hobby, created a website for a personal YouTube channel, and totally fell in love with development! I ended up getting really invested, and was able to participate in a full-stack developer apprenticeship, with the BEST people I could've asked for. That fueled my career change, and I've been able to continue working with those amazing humans. Below are some of the projects I worked on before my apprenticeship. You'll be able to see the improvements as you browse through older repos, to more recent repos (hopefully ðŸ¤ž). Feel free to visit my portfolio site for more details on each of these!
